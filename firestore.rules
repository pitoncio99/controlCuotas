/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Finance Management App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal financial data (persons, purchase installments, expenses, incomes) stored under the `/users/{userId}` path.
 * Globally available data (cards) are stored under the `/cards/{cardId}` path.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/persons/{personId}: Information about people, owned by the user.
 * - /cards/{cardId}: Globally available card information.
 * - /users/{userId}/purchaseInstallments/{purchaseInstallmentId}: Purchase installment data for a user.
 * - /users/{userId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Expense data for a user.
 * - /users/{userId}/incomes/{incomeId}: Income data for a user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly owned and controlled by the user ID in the path.
 * - Cards are globally readable but writable only by authenticated users. This is a common pattern for seed data.
 * - List operations are enabled for owners on their respective user subcollections.
 * - Data validation ensures that the user ID in the path matches the creator's ID.
