# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Deploying Your Application

This project is configured to use Firebase App Hosting for automatic deployments.

### How it Works

1.  **Link to GitHub**: Connect this project to a new or existing GitHub repository.
2.  **Push Your Code**: Every time you push your code to the `main` branch, Firebase App Hosting will automatically build and deploy your application.
3.  **Your Site is Live**: After the first push, your site will be live! You can find the URL for your live site in the Firebase console for your project.

### Deployment Steps

If you have already linked your GitHub repository, the only step to publish your site is to push your changes:

```bash
# (If you haven't already) Add all your files and create a commit
git add .
git commit -m "My first version"

# Push your code to GitHub to trigger the deployment
git push -u origin main
```

That's it! There's no separate hosting provider to configure. The hosting is handled for you.
